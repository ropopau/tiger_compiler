  /** \brief Binding identifier uses to their definitions.
   **
   ** When the \c Binder finds a declaration (of a variable/formal, function,
   ** or type), it keeps a pointer to it.  When it finds a use, it binds it
   ** to its definition, i.e., it annotates it with a pointer to the
   ** declaration.
   **
   ** The \c Binder diagnoses identifier use errors (invalid multiple
   ** definitions, unbound identifiers etc.).
   **
   ** Since identifier bindings depend on scopes, it needs an environment.
   **
   ** In the original Tiger by A. Appel, there are two namespaces: on
   ** the one hand types, and on the other hand functions and variables.
   ** Here, at EPITA, we will use three name spaces: we will allow
   ** variables and functions with the same name.
   **
   ** Moreover, object constructs make use of two additional name
   ** spaces: one for class attributes and one for methods (actually
   ** these two name spaces only live within the scope of a class).
   **
   ** Note that this Binder is mainly doing nothing: it is just
   ** interested in declarations and uses.  To avoid writing
   ** all the methods that `do nothing but walk', it derives
   ** from \c ast::DefaultVisitor.
